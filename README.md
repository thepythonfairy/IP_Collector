# IP_Collector
⚠️**Disclaimer** 
This project is intended for educational and ethical testing purposes only. Do not use it without proper authorization or consent. The author (in this case I) is not responsible for any misuse.

Important Notes:
You will need to utilize a cloud-based platform such as pythonanywhere.com to host your code. Otherwise, you will need to host the program locally (in your router) which can cause some vulnerability issues.

First Step:
Go to pythonanywhere.come and create an account. 

Second Step:
Go to the files tab and click on flask_app.py

Third Step:
Under Directories, click mysite/ and that should get you started!

Remember:
Once you finish coding, go to Slack or Discord (both work) and create a webhook. This is how you will get notified when someone clicks the IP_Collector link and it will also be where you can see the user's IP Address, Date, Location, and Postal Code
